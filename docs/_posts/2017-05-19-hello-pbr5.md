## What PBR5 is

[Some kind of hook: This is a project create better procedurally generated images!]
[or maybe its okay to take this general->specific approach and end the first bit with the hook]
[this hook could then lead straight to the visual comparisons, which should really "set the hook"]

Most digital images—and most digital image authoring software—represent images as pixels that encode only the image’s color. These images do not describe other properties such as how shiny, metallic, or thick each pixel is. These material properties are important expressive aspects of traditional media image-making; their absence often leads to “flat” or “lifeless” images.

[the effect is more pronouced when the object or lights are moving, or with more dramatic environments/lighting]


[show different lighting? another post?]

Image: RGB Textured Object
Image: RGB+ Texture Object
Image: 2D RGB Image with just
Image: 2D RGB+ Image with baked in lighting (probably brush strokes and paint thickness would demo well)

[While screens can't directly recreate these qualities, a light simulation program can simulate how an surfaces with these qualites would interact with modeled lighting scenarios. Therefore, these kinds of images are very well suited to realtime 3D graphics, games, and VR experiences. It is also possible to post process a 2D, applying lighting that reacts with these extended attributes, and baking the result into a simple rgb image. Finally, while digital screens cannot recreate qualities like smoothness and metallicness and height, it is somewhat possible to recreate these qualities in printed material using methods like selective gloss coating, foil stamping, and embossing. It might be interesting to use this system to create images wiht print in mind.]

[[bit about students]Creating richer, more lifelike images is difficult especiall for] creative-field students are first learning digital image-making and creative coding. This, in turn, can contribute to reduced student interest in creative coding.

[[bit about pros]pros also need tools for creating these textures in their realitme graphics pipelines for games, VR and other realtime apps. Substance designer is great, but its node based approach makes is great for some things, inconvient for others]

[[goal summary->hook]The goal of this project is to create a prototype of a javascript library for creating procedurally generated images that contain extended information representing these additional material properties.
and to explore using this library in educational contexts [and pro contexts] to connect the disciplines of creative coding, 3D rendering, VR, and traditional media.]

## Additional Properties

[We are going to begin by supporting extended image qualities that are supported by the popular Unity3d game engine. These are common, powerful qualities.]

albedo code, image, brief description of what this quality does.
metallic code, image, brief description of what this quality does.
smoothness code, image, brief description of what this quality does.
height code, image, brief description of what this quality does.
emission code, image, brief description of what this quality does.
combined code, image, brief description of what this quality does.


## Physically Based Rendering
[this section may adjust based upon how much we suggest what pbr is up top]
Most digital images, and most digital image authoring software and libraries, represent images as pixels that encode only the image’s color. These images and packages do not describe other properties of the image such as how shiny, metallic, or thick each pixel is. These material properties are important expressive aspects of traditional media image-making.

Physically Based Rendering (PBR) is method of 3D rendering which seeks to simulate the real-world interactions of light and materials more accurately than previous rendering models. PBR materials use multiple images (maps) to represent material properties such as albedo (color), roughness, metallic response, emissive color, and height.

Tools for creating and rendering PBR materials have become more widespread in the past few years. Unity 3D, a real-time engine used for game and interactive application development, introduced PBR support in 2015. Authoring packages such as Substance Designer, Substance Painter, and Quixel, allow artists to work with this more expressive representation of images using familiar tools. Combining this pipeline with VR enables powerful tools for creating virtual prototypes and material studies very quickly.

Unity takes images like this:

image: map 1
image: map 2
image: map 3

And simulates light to create

image: rendering

## Goals

This project would include: designing, developing, documenting, and publishing the prototype library; testing the library with students and creative-coding community members; and hosting a community hackathon.

Primary goals
- just an alpha
- just added data channels

Secondary goals
- textureing/edging
- random toolkit
- one
- two
- three

Strech goals?
