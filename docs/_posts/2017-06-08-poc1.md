Version .1 of PBR5 is done. It is very minimal still—just a couple very basic features—but is enough to start making some sketches and test the core idea. Talia used this version of the library to make a [pretty nice brick texture]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-06-13-bricks.md %}) and I made a sketch that looks something like paint splatters.

## Materials
The most essential aspect of the library is the ability to define a full PBR material with base color, metallic, smoothness, and height channels. The `Material` class is used to do this. In the future, this class will likely also contain additional information, such as how each channel should be composited during drawing.

```javascript
// describing a material with PBR channels
let exampleMaterial = new Material(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25);

// or
let exampleMaterial = new Material();
exampleMaterial.red = 1.0;
exampleMaterial.green = 0.0;
exampleMaterial.blue = 0.0;
exampleMaterial.transparency = 1.0;
exampleMaterial.height = 0.5;
exampleMaterial.metallic = 0.5;
exampleMaterial.smoothness = 0.25;
```

## Drawing Rects
For a material to be useful, you need to be able to draw with it. The `rect` function allows you to draw a simple rectangle. It takes parameters for the location and size of the rectangle, and the material to draw with.

```javascript
// drawing a rectangle
pbr.rect(10, 10, 100, 25, exampleMaterial);
```

## Under the Hood
When the PBR5 library is initialized, it creates a number of offscreen drawing buffers to store the base color, metallic + smoothness, and height information. These buffers are larger than the exported textures, allowing for anti-aliasing oversampling. The buffers are also high precision—they use 16-bit half-floats—allowing for high dynamic range drawing. The `pbr.rect()` function draws a rectangle into each of these buffers using the data in the material parameter.

## Exporting
The library also provides methods for exporting the data channels as textures that can be used with the Unity game engine. Currently it exports textures for albedo, metallic+smoothness, and height.

## Examples
Even with only the ability to draw rectangles, the library already shows promise as a powerful tool for created procedurally generated textures that work with a PBR rendering pipeline.
